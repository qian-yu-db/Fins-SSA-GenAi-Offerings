See the correctness rationale for more details. **Suggested Actions**: Consider improving the prompt template to encourage direct, specific responses, re-ranking retrievals to provide more relevant chunks to the LLM earlier in the prompt, or using a more capable LLM.</td><td>yes</td><td>No harmful content detected in response</td><td>no</td><td>The expectation states that the insurance policy will cover damages sustained by anyone else as a result of bodily injury, and will pay for damages arising out of bodily injury to two or more persons in any one motor vehicle accident, with a maximum limit that will not be increased even if there are multiple claims or vehicles involved. The response confirms that the insurance policy will cover damages sustained by anyone as a result of bodily injury, up to the maximum limit stated in the policy, but does not specifically mention the scenario of two or more persons in one accident or the non-increase of the maximum limit with multiple claims or vehicles.   The expectation also mentions funeral service expenses benefits in the event of an insured person's death as a direct result of a covered auto accident, but the response does not mention funeral service expenses benefits.  The expectation states that to make a claim, the insured person or their representative must provide written proof of claim, including all details reasonably required by the insurance company, and that the insurance company may require the insured person to submit to questioning under oath and sign the transcript. The response does not provide details on the process of making a claim or the requirement for questioning under oath.  The expectation notes certain exclusions, such as death sustained in the course of an occupation or due to suicide, and that the insurance company has the right to investigate and settle claims. The response confirms exclusions for damages sustained in the course of an occupation or due to suicide, and mentions that the company may settle any claim or suit if they believe it is proper.  Finally, the expectation states that the policy provides for the payment of certain expenses, such as court costs and interest on damages awarded. The response confirms the payment of court costs for defense but does not mention interest on damages awarded.  Therefore, the expectation is not fully supported by the response.</td><td>yes</td><td>The response states that the insurance policy will cover damages sustained by anyone as a result of bodily injury, up to the maximum limit stated in the policy. The retrieved context confirms this by stating that 'EACH ACCIDENT' is the maximum that will be paid for damages arising out of bodily injury to two or more persons in any one motor vehicle accident. The response also mentions that the policy covers property damage and provides liability coverage for the insured person. The retrieved context supports this by stating that the policy protects an insured person from liability for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of an insured auto. The response further states that the insurance company will pay for damages that the insured person is legally obligated to pay and will defend the insured person in a lawsuit, even if the suit is groundless or false. The retrieved context confirms this by stating that the company will defend an insured person sued for damages covered by the policy, even if the suit is groundless or false. The response mentions additional payments such as up to $50 per day for loss of wages or salary if the insured person is required to attend hearings or trials, and court costs for defense. The retrieved context supports this by stating that the company will pay up to $50 a day for loss of wages or salary if the insured person is asked to attend hearings or trials, and will pay court costs for defense. The response also notes certain exclusions and limitations, such as not covering damages sustained in the course of an occupation, or due to suicide, war, or other specific circumstances. The retrieved context supports this by listing exclusions such as damages sustained in the course of an occupation, due to suicide, war, or other specific circumstances. Therefore, the response is fully supported by the retrieved context.</td><td>yes</td><td>The ground truth states that the insurance policy will cover damages sustained by anyone else as a result of bodily injury, which is supported by the retrieved context: 'MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT, INCLUDING DAMAGES SUSTAINED BY ANYONE ELSE AS A result OF THAT BODILY INJURY'. The ground truth also mentions that the policy will pay for damages arising out of bodily injury to two or more persons in any one motor vehicle accident, with a maximum limit that will not be increased even if there are multiple claims or vehicles involved. This is supported by the retrieved context: 'EACH ACCIDENT' IS THE MAXIMUM THAT WE WILL PAY FOR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF BODILY INJURY TO TWO OR MORE PERSONS IN ANY ONE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT. THIS LIMIT IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMIT FOR 'EACH PERSON'. The ground truth further states that the policy provides for funeral service expenses benefits in the event of an insured person's death as a direct result of a covered auto accident, which is supported by the retrieved context: 'If an insured person dies as the result of a covered auto accident, we will pay the least of the following as a funeral service expenses benefit'. The ground truth mentions that to make a claim, the insured person or their representative must provide written proof of claim, including all details reasonably required by the insurance company, and that the insurance company may also require the insured person to submit to questioning under oath and sign the transcript. This is supported by the retrieved context: 'As soon as possible, you or any other person making claim must give us written proof of claim, including all details reasonably required by us to determine the amounts payable. We may also require any person making claim to submit to questioning under oath and sign the transcript'. The ground truth notes that the policy has certain exclusions, such as death sustained in the course of an occupation or due to suicide, and that the insurance company has the right to investigate and settle claims. This is supported by the retrieved context: 'This coverage does not apply to death: 1. sustained in the course of an occupation by any person while: a) operating, loading, unloading, assisting on, or performing any other duties related to the use of a commercial auto, or an auto hired or rented to others for a charge. b) repairing or servicing autos, including any related duties. 2. due to suicide committed while sane or insane'. The ground truth also states that the policy provides for the payment of certain expenses, such as court costs and interest on damages awarded, which is supported by the retrieved context: 'Additional Payments Autosure Will Make When we defend an insured person under this part, we will pay... 2. court costs for defense. 3. interest accruing on damages awarded'. Therefore, all parts of the ground truth are supported by the retrieved context.</td><td>6443</td><td>6201</td><td>242</td><td>4.882</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"

The response confirms that the insurance policy will cover damages sustained by anyone as a result of bodily injury, up to the maximum limit stated in the policy, but does not specifically mention the scenario of two or more persons in one accident or the non-increase of the maximum limit with multiple claims or vehicles.   The expectation also mentions funeral service expenses benefits in the event of an insured person's death as a direct result of a covered auto accident, but the response does not mention funeral service expenses benefits.  The expectation states that to make a claim, the insured person or their representative must provide written proof of claim, including all details reasonably required by the insurance company, and that the insurance company may require the insured person to submit to questioning under oath and sign the transcript. The response does not provide details on the process of making a claim or the requirement for questioning under oath.  The expectation notes certain exclusions, such as death sustained in the course of an occupation or due to suicide, and that the insurance company has the right to investigate and settle claims.
