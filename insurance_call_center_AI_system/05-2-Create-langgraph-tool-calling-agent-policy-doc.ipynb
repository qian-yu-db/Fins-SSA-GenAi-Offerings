The policy also covers property damage and provides liability coverage for the insured person.\\\\n\\\\nTo make a claim, the insured person must provide written proof of claim, including all details reasonably required by the insurance company. The insurance company may require the insured person to submit to questioning under oath and sign the transcript.

            "Based on the provided policy documents, in the event of a car accident, the insurance policy will cover damages sustained by anyone else as a result of bodily injury. The policy will pay for damages arising out of bodily injury to two or more persons in any one motor vehicle accident, up to the maximum limit stated in the policy. The policy also covers property damage and provides liability coverage for the insured person.\n\nTo make a claim, the insured person must provide written proof of claim, including all details reasonably required by the insurance company. The insurance company may require the insured person to submit to questioning under oath and sign the transcript. The insured person may also be required to take medical examinations by physicians selected by the insurance company.\n\nIt's important to note that the policy has certain exclusions and limitations, such as not covering death sustained in the course of an occupation or due to suicide. The policy also has a provision for subrogation, which means that the insurance company has the right to recover from anyone else who may be responsible for the damages.\n\nIf you have any further questions or would like more specific information, please let me know and I'll do my best to help.",

The policy will pay for damages arising out of bodily injury to two or more persons in any one motor vehicle accident, up to the maximum limit stated in the policy. The policy also covers property damage and provides liability coverage for the insured person.\\\\n\\\\nTo make a claim, the insured person must provide written proof of claim, including all details reasonably required by the insurance company. The insurance company may require the insured person to submit to questioning under oath and sign the transcript. The insured person may also be required to take medical examinations by physicians selected by the insurance company.\\\\n\\\\nIt's important to note that the policy has certain exclusions and limitations, such as not covering death sustained in the course of an occupation or due to suicide. The policy also has a provision for subrogation, which means that the insurance company has the right to recover from anyone else who may be responsible for the damages.\\\\n\\\\nIf you have any further questions or would like more specific information, please let me know and I'll do my best to help.\\\", \\\"additional_kwargs\\\": {}, \\\"response_metadata\\\": {\\\"prompt_tokens\\\": 5433, \\\"completion_tokens\\\": 235, \\\"total_tokens\\\": 5668}, \\\"type\\\": \\\"ai\\\", \\\"name\\\": null, \\\"id\\\": \\\"run-8b88c3ef-b106-4c78-8bed-3d388e9369cf-0\\\", \\\"example\\\": false, \\\"tool_calls\\\": [], \\\"invalid_tool_calls\\\": [], \\\"usage_metadata\\\": null}\"}, \"events\": []}, {\"name\": \"RunnableLambda_2\", \"context\": {\"span_id\": \"0xb731213a5dbc3bfa\", \"trace_id\": \"0x6ce821b39ab400b60c416614673779a1\"}, \"parent_id\": \"0xad90f049f459b6f5\", \"start_time\": 1741824307122551853, \"end_time\": 1741824307123557704, \"status_code\": \"OK\", \"status_message\": \"\", \"attributes\": {\"mlflow.traceRequestId\": \"\\\"tr-73e2a814b197427f8237e54c6557f946\\\"\", \"mlflow.spanType\": \"\\\"CHAIN\\\"\", \"metadata\": \"{\\\"langgraph_step\\\": 3, \\\"langgraph_node\\\": \\\"agent\\\", \\\"langgraph_triggers\\\": [\\\"tools\\\"], \\\"langgraph_path\\\": [\\\"__pregel_pull\\\", \\\"agent\\\"], \\\"langgraph_checkpoint_ns\\\": \\\"agent:d2c23e7e-68fe-4ea6-f8af-adbfd60b3cbb\\\", \\\"checkpoint_ns\\\": \\\"agent:d2c23e7e-68fe-4ea6-f8af-adbfd60b3cbb\\\"}\", \"mlflow.spanInputs\": \"{\\\"messages\\\": [{\\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Car accident claim policy\\\", \\\"id\\\": \\\"c0c95350-dfcd-48c6-93e2-8ed1cb6fcb22\\\"}, {\\\"role\\\": \\\"assistant\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"id\\\": \\\"run-5e294de2-28d4-40b7-81ea-3aa538a7abfe-0\\\", \\\"tool_calls\\\": [{\\\"id\\\": \\\"call_6251084c-4c42-43c8-ac88-a703ebad55c9\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"function\\\", \\\"function\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"policy_doc_search\\\", \\\"arguments\\\": \\\"{\\\\\\\"query\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"car accident claim policy\\\\\\\"}\\\"}, \\\"name\\\": \\\"policy_doc_search\\\", \\\"args\\\": {\\\"query\\\": \\\"car accident claim policy\\\"}}]}, {\\\"role\\\": \\\"tool\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"[Document(metadata={'chunk_id': '10403fe747e34f845114d226b570915f'}, page_content='MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT, INCLUDING\\\\\\\\nDAMAGES SUSTAINED BYANYONE ELSE ASA\\\\\\\\nRESULT OFTHAT BODILY INJURY .\\\\\\\\n2.\\\\\\\"EACH ACCIDENT\\\\\\\" ISTHEMAXIMUM THAT WE\\\\\\\\nWILL PAY FORDAMAGES ARISING OUT OF\\\\\\\\nBODILY INJURY TOTWO ORMORE PERSONS\\\\\\\\nINANY ONE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT.

The policy also covers property damage and provides liability coverage for the insured person.\n\nTo make a claim, the insured person must provide written proof of claim, including all details reasonably required by the insurance company.
